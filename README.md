# JavaScript Mini Projects

Welcome to the JavaScript Mini Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of small projects built using vanilla JavaScript, focusing on DOM manipulation and user interaction.

## Projects Overview

### üìù Task 1: Dynamic To-Do List
**Objective**: Create a simple to-do list application using vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

**Requirements**:
- **Add Items**: Allow the user to add tasks to the list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Add a feature to mark tasks as complete, visually indicating the change (e.g., strikethrough or color change).
- **Delete Items**: Provide the ability to delete tasks from the list.
- **Persist Data**: Store the list in LocalStorage so that the tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.

**Bonus Challenge**: Implement an "Edit" button for each task, allowing users to modify a task after it‚Äôs been added.

### üìù Task 2: Countdown Timer
**Objective**: Build a countdown timer that counts down from a user-specified time and displays the remaining time dynamically.

**Requirements**:
- **Input Time**: Allow the user to input a time in minutes and seconds.
- **Start/Stop/Pause**: Provide buttons to start, stop, and pause the countdown.
- **Alert on Completion**: Display an alert or change the DOM to indicate when the timer has finished.

**Bonus Challenge**: Add an option to play a sound or display a custom message when the countdown reaches zero.

### üìù Task 3: Image Carousel
**Objective**: Create an image carousel/slideshow that automatically cycles through a set of images and allows for manual navigation.

**Requirements**:
- **Auto-Cycle**: The images should automatically transition every few seconds.
- **Manual Navigation**: Provide "Next" and "Previous" buttons to allow users to manually cycle through the images.
- **Indicator Dots**: Show indicator dots at the bottom of the carousel that reflect the current image and allow users to click to jump to any specific image.

**Bonus Challenge**: Add a smooth transition effect between images.

### üìù Task 4: Form Validation
**Objective**: Build a web form with multiple input fields and implement custom validation logic.

**Requirements**:
- **Input Fields**: Include fields like name, email, password, and a date picker.
- **Custom Validation**: Implement custom validation rules (e.g., password strength, valid email format, required fields).
- **Error Messages**: Display appropriate error messages when validation fails.
- **Prevent Form Submission**: Prevent the form from submitting if validation fails, and ensure the validation messages are user-friendly.

**Bonus Challenge**: Implement LocalStorage to save the user's input temporarily, so they don't lose their progress if they accidentally refresh the page.

### üìù Task 5: Interactive Quiz App
**Objective**: Develop a small quiz application with multiple-choice questions.

**Requirements**:
- **Question Display**: Show one question at a time with 4 answer options.
- **Score Tracking**: Track the user's score and display it at the end of the quiz.
- **Feedback**: Provide instant feedback after each question indicating whether the user's answer was correct or incorrect.
- **Dynamic Data**: Store the questions in a JavaScript array or object and dynamically generate the quiz interface from this data.

**Bonus Challenge**: Implement a timer for each question and reduce points for incorrect answers based on how long it takes the user to answer.
